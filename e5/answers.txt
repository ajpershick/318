1)  Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

    I used np.sqrt to get the best results I could get. This gave me:
    Transformed data normality p-values: 0.0369 0.108
    Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 0.556
    This means one passes the 95% confidence level test for normality, and one fails.
    However they pass the levene test for equal variance, which is better than np.log which fails.

2)  I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing.
    Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test.
    That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

    The null hypothesis is that the means of the samples are the same.
    This gets rejected at a 0.05 significance level with a T test p value of 1.3e-58 for the original for example.
    If we got a value like this for the transformed data, it would also be rejected.

3)  Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question:
    “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?”
    Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

    I would say transforming them was the best approach because we could make sure the normality and equal variance
    was intact for the T Test to work properly by assumption. Then finding a very small p-value indicates a good result.

4)  When are more Reddit comment posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

    Weekends had a mean of 1269.5, whereas weekdays had 1823.6.
    Therefore, more Reddit comments are posted on average on weekdays.
