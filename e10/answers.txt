    (1) reddit-0: 11.389s
    (2) reddit-2 (without schema or caching): 23.339s
    (3) reddit-2 (with schema, no caching): 18.192s
    (4) reddit-2 (with schema and caching): 15.012s

2)  Looks like the majority of time is spent reading the files based off
    my results above. By simply setting the schema and caching,
    we drop about a third of the total time.

3)  From thoroughly timing/testing the wikipedia_popular program, caching in
    many different locations, I found that caching right after the max function
    faired quite well in efficiency compared to the other locations. This makes sense as
    we wouldn't want to keep taking the max and reading every time.
