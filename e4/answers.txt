1)  Based on your results for the last question,
    do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density?
    Briefly explain why or why not.

    It seems like there is little to no correlation between Average Max Temperature
    and Population Density in the plot. Based on this evidence, I believe there is no
    reason to conclude that an increase or decrease in daily temperatures have any affect on population density
    based on the lack of a linear relationship. However, we might assume that since the majority of the data
    is found in the 15-25 degree range that maybe that is the ideal preference for people to reside.
    This however would probably have to be proven in another study with a better null hypothesis.

2)  The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed throughout the analysis.
    Constantly decompressing the data seems inefficient.
    Why might this be faster than working with the uncompressed .json data?

    The biggest advantage of compressed JSON is it can be compressed up to +80%.
    It is much easier and more efficient to decompress and parse at the same time rather than
    decompressing then reading and parsing because of the size of decompressed JSON objects.
