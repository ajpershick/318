1)  Being the curious student I am, I decided to thoroughly test my program with
    various caches. My best results came from caching right after the read function.
    I believe that doing this prevents the program from re-reading the data form the JSON format
    each time it does a calculation.

2)  Using the hadoop cluster web ui, I determine these results from the runs:

    38 seconds without broadcasting
    27 seconds with broadcasting

    Cut off around a third of the running time.
