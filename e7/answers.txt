1)  Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to
    being normal to look at the OLS p-value?
    Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?

    I think by just taking a look at the histogram, the data seems reasonably normal.
    However, you could run a normal test on it to determine if it is normal enough to assume that.
    If we do assume that it is normal enough, then looking at the pvalue (4.68648499391e-74)
    confidently concludes, even at a 99% confidence level, that the slope is not 0
    and therefore increasing due to the positive slope of the graph.

2)  Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a
    better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

    The new prediction is letting the Kalman filter accurately represent the noise/data
    but still doesn't seem to smooth out the data at all. Tweaking the std deviations
    moves the filter perfectly onto the data with a difference of >= around 0.5
    in observation/predictions. Changing these values however only shifts the data and
    we are not able to smooth the data doing this while keeping the correct representation.
    I would conclude that the new Kalman filter is not doing a good enough job at representing
    the true signal because of the amount of noise in the curve.
