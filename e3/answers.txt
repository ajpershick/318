#### Answers for Exercise 3 ####

(1) I think that Kalman returned better results for my output. There was more you could tweak in
    Kalman filtering that could be shaped rather than just a simple frac value.
    My Kalman's plot ended up a lot smoother than my LOESS, however it had a minor loss of
    outlier values for the heat spikes. The Kalman had less of a downside of
    smoothing out the plot than the LOESS filtering, which was heavily impacted by smoothing.
    Kalman filtering seems to be better because of assumptions made using Trans and Obs covariances.
    LOESS is probably more useful when you have loads of data and don't know a lot about where it came from.

(2) It seems to me that timestamps could be quite useful if they were collected independently.
    They could get rid of some assumptions we make such as "Was Greg consistently walking at 1m/s??".
    We could more precisely calculate speed and distance using timestamps, making the
    smoothing process a lot easier.
