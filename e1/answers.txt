# Answers for Exercise 1

1) I'd say they are very similar in difficulty to work with but I like the layout
   of dataframes because they are lovely to look at. Being able to view a dataframe in
   an excel like table is very visually appealing and doesn't lack in functionality at all.

2) pivot_months_loops: 578 ms ± 36.1 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
   pivot_months_pandas: 21.3 ms ± 3.77 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

   The main reason I believe that it is so much quicker to use the pandas method is
   because of the lack of loops. Looping through arrays is quite costly and being able to perform functions
   on entire arrays instead of going through each element is much more efficient.
